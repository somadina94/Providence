          <p>
            A stocks & shares ISA (Individual Savings Account) is an account
            that you can use for your investments. It's a tax-efficient way to
            grow your investments because, you can invest up to â‚¬20,000 in the
            current tax year, without paying any income tax or capital gains
            tax. The value of tax benefits will depend on your circumstances and
            tax rules may change in the future. Remember the value of
            investments can go down as well as up, so you may not get back what
            you invest.
